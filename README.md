technologies used:
I used a ton of JavaScript DOM manipulation for the game functionality. 

approach taken:
My highest priority was a 100% completely functional game and I changed up my process for this project to do so. Instead of creating the HTML and heavily styling the CSS before writing JavaScript, I simply created a minimum viable product when considering the CSS. This allowed me to work through the most difficult challenges (JavaScript!) earlier on. My JS code was extremely wet the first time around, but that's find because my priority was a completely functional game. Utilizing the trello board was invaluable. This process allowed me to 1) analyze each step by itself, 2) better manage the order of each step according to my priorities and 3) have a better understanding of where I stood at each point of the project.

installation instructions:
Go to the first url listed above, this will take you to the landing page. If you click on the 'PLAY NOW' button it will direct you to the game page. Player 1 begins the game by clicking a 'place chip' button and the game alternates between Player 1 and 2. The game ends when all squares are filled or someone gets four in a row. You can reset the game using the appropriate button any time. That's all you need to know!
