	<p>Instructions</p>
	<p>Players alternate placing chips on the board. To win, you must get four chips in a row - either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. You'll quickly notice the twist of Reverse Gravity Connect Four is that gravity is reversed! Each player will place a chip with the buttons located below the board and the piece will fall to the top of the board.</p>
