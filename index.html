		<p>Instructions: <br/><br/>Players alternate placing chips on the board. To win, you must get four chips in a row - either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. You'll quickly notice the twist of RGC4 is that gravity is reversed!<!-- Each player will place a chip with the buttons located below the board and the piece will fall to the top of the board.--></p>
